Abstract: Intensive agriculture practices often results in decomposition of organic matter, thus 
causing soil CO2 emissions. Agro-ecological service crop could be profitably cultivated to improve 
soil characteristics and reduce CO2 emissions under Mediterranean environment. Two-year field 
trials were conducted in central Italy. The treatments were three agro-ecological service crops (hairy 
vetch, oat, and oilseed rape) and a no-service cover. Plant development, soil characteristics, and 
CO2 emissions were measured. Oat and oilseed rape showed a rapid growth, while hairy vetch 
started to grow rapidly only after the cold period. Soil CO2 emissions trend was similar among 
the agro-ecological service crops and tended to decrease during the cold period, then gradually 
increased until April when warm temperatures were observed. The high soil CO2 emissions and 
respiration index observed in hairy vetch probably stimulated mineral nutrients, especially nitrogen, 
to become more available in the soil compared to oat and oilseed rape throughout the decomposition 
of soil organic matter. These results confirmed that the cultivation of agro-ecological service crops, 
especially hairy vetch, could represent a suitable strategy for enhancing carbon sequestration and 
lead to a mitigation of CO2 emissions during the fallow period and could thus contribute to the 
climate change mitigation.

1. Introduction 
Agriculture is considered one of the human activities that results in high production of CO2 [1]. 
In particular, conventional agricultural practices contribute about 25% of the total anthropogenic CO2 
emissions and cause about 50% of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss [2]. Conventional land management 
is based on intensive agriculture practices, such as deep tillage, high inorganic nitrogen fertilizer 
addition, and irrigation, and often results in the rapid decomposition of organic matter through 
microbial activities, thus causing high soil CO2 emissions and losses of SOC [2]. However, soil 
microbes play a number of vital functions in the soil and the microbial breakdown of organic matter of 
the soil not only affects CO2 emission, but also contributes to the release of nutrients into the soil, such 
as nitrogen, phosphorous, and others, that are essential for plant establishment and development [3]. 
Thus, CO2 emissions due to soil respiration are also an important indicator to assess nutrient cycling.

For these reasons, sustainable soil management is needed in order to enhance SOC in cropland, 
based on the chemical, physical, and biological properties of the soils [3.5]. The reduction of CO2 
emissions by soil carbon sequestration is of primary importance as agricultural activities could remove 
atmospheric carbon by sequestration and thus mitigate climate change by maintaining and enhancing 
the amount of carbon stored in the soil and plant material. The challenge of sustainable agriculture is 
to develop crop rotation schemes and increase soil carbon (C) stocks by the adoption of management 
strategies that could include adding manure or other organic amendments [6], leaving crop residues 
on the field [7], reducing soil disturbance [8], and including cover crops [5]. 
Cover crops are commonly identified as agro-ecological service crops because they may bring 
multiple benefits to agro-ecosystem [9], including suppression of weeds and pests [10], improvement 
of soil and water quality, and stimulation of nutrient cycles [11]. Among the several benefit of 
agro-ecological service crops, the enhancement of SOC and nitrogen sequestration through the 
production of fresh organic matter has the potential to mitigate climate changes [12.15]. In fact, 
the aboveground and belowground biomass from agro-ecological service crops is considered as net 
primary production of C and represent a net flux of CO2-C from the atmosphere into the biomass 
tissues [16]. Therefore, replacing bare soil with agro-ecological service crops has been widely accepted 
as a sustainable agricultural practice, even if the species of agro-ecological service crop to cultivate in 
crop rotation should be based on the biological, environmental, social, cultural, and economic factors 
where farmers operate [17]. Under Mediterranean climate conditions, agro-ecological service crops are 
commonly cultivated from early autumn to spring, when they achieve the highest level of biomass 
production and are then suppressed mechanically or chemically before the cultivation of the main 
summer vegetable or grain crops [18,19]. The most extensively used agro-ecological service crops are 
legumes and grasses that are able to accumulate nitrogen and produce a large amount of biomass. 
However, there is an increasing interest in crucifers which may act as biofumigants and suppress soil 
pests, especially root pathogens and parasitic nematodes [11]. Grass used as agro-ecological service 
crop include the annual cereal that are very useful for scavenging nutrients, mainly nitrogen, due to its 
developed root systems and produce high amount of biomass that can help to add organic matter to 
the soil [3]. Although several studies evaluated the impact of agro-ecological service crops on pest 
management and nutrient cycling, little is known about their effect on soil CO2 emissions and C balance 
during their cultivation period. This current study hypothesizes that in Mediterranean environment 
the replacement of bare soil with the adoption of adequate agro-ecological service crop can be profitably 
used for sustainable agriculture to improve carbon accumulation and soil characteristics also during 
their growing season. The evaluation of this assumption is of particular interest to improve the 
knowledge on biomass production, soil characteristics, and soil carbon emissions in the Mediterranean 
environment. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of agro-ecological 
service crops at their termination on: (i) Soil CO2 emissions trend and short-term carbon balance, (ii) 
biomass production and characteristics, and (iii) soil properties. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Description of the Study Area and Experimental Design 
Field trials were conducted in the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 growing seasons of the agro-ecological 
service crops at the experimental farm of the University of Tuscia located in Central Italy (45250 N, 
12040 E and 310 m above sea level). The soil was classified as Typic Xerofluvent of volcanic origin with 
the following average characteristics in the 0.30 cm layer: 10.9% clay, 14.3% silt, 74.8% sand; pH 6.5 
(water, 1:2.5 w:v); organic matter 1.2%; total N 0.89 g kg..1; available P 35 mg kg..1; and exchangeable 
K 569 mg kg..1. 
The climate of the study area is moderate thermo-Mediterranean with average temperature of 
14.3 C. The lowest mean temperature (on average, 0 C) was observed in winter period, especially 
in January and February, while the highest mean temperature (on average, 35 C) was observed in

Agriculture 2019, 9, 71 3 of 13 
summer period, especially in July and August. Annual rainfall was 752 mm, on average, based on the 
30-year period and was mainly concentrated from September to May. 
The field experiments were carried out in two adjacent fields of the same site previously cropped 
with durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.). Each experimental field was 4800 m2 (60 m  80 m), which 
made it possible to perform all farming operations with agricultural machinery. The experimental 
treatments consisted in: Three agro-ecological service crops (hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth. var. 
Capello), oat (Avena sativa L. var. Donata), and oilseed rape (Brassica napus L. var. Licapo)) and a bare 
soil with no cover. The experimental treatments were arranged in a randomized block design with 
three blocks for a total of 12 plots. 
2.2. Field Set-Up and Crop Management 
In September, at the beginning of each growing season of the agro-ecological service crops, 
the soil was ploughed at a depth of 30 cm and fertilized with triple super phosphate at the rate of 
100 kg P2O5 ha..1. The day after, the soil was harrowed to a depth of 10 cm in order to prepare the 
seedbed. About one week from the seedbed preparation on 24 September 2009, and 13 September 
2010, the seeds of hairy vetch, oat and oilseed rape were hand broadcast at the rates of 60, 100, and 
15 kg ha..1, respectively, then the seeds were buried by harrowing to a depth of 2 cm. The bare soil 
plots were treated similarly to the other plots and it was kept bare throughout the agro-ecological 
service crop growing season by hand weeding when the weeds start to emerge. The growing season of 
all agro-ecological service crops was mechanically terminated in 20 May 2010, and 4 May 2011, when 
hairy vetch was at the flowering stage and oat and oilseed rape were in the milk stage. 
2.3. Sampling and Measurements 
The photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD, mol m..2 s..1) transmitted by the agro-ecological 
services crops was measured at ground level. The measurements were performed every seven days 
from the emergence to mechanical suppression of the agro-ecological services crops by using a linear 
ceptometer (SS1-UM-2.0, DELTA-T devices LDT, Cambridge, England). The ceptometer was placed 
horizontally at ground level five times in the central part of each plot. All measurements were carried 
out under full sunlight on clear days between 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. The fraction of PPFD intercepted 
(FiPPFD) was calculated using the following formula: 
FiPPFD = [1 .. (Io/It)] (1) 
where the Io is the average of five measured PPFD on the surface of the ground and It is the radiant 
flux density on the top of the agro-ecological service crop canopy. The FiPPFD equal to 1 or 0 indicates 
all or no PPFD intercepted, respectively. 
Just before the suppression of the agro-ecological service crops, the biomass samples were 
collected. The aboveground biomass was hand-clipped at the soil surface and collected by placing 
a quadrat 50 cm  50 cm (0.25 m2) randomly four times over the central part. The entire aboveground 
biomass samples were separated into leaf and stem fractions. The stem fraction included stems and 
inflorescences. Each fraction was dried, after which they were weighed to determine leaf/stem ratios. 
The belowground biomass was determined collecting roots from each plot at 0.30 cm depth with 
hand-operated soil core sampler (8 cm diameter and 15 cm height). The roots were removed from 
soil sample by pouring slurry of distillated water through a 50 m screen and the retained roots were 
rinsed under water. Subsamples of boot shoot and root biomass were dried to calculate the shoot/root 
ratio, and were then homogenized with a mill for carbon and nitrogen content determination using 
an elementary analyzer (Thermo Soil NC - Flash EA1112, Lakewood, NJ, USA). The total N or C 
accumulation were calculated by multiplying the biomass of agro-ecological service crop with the 
corresponding N or C concentration value, respectively.

At the suppression of the agro-ecological service crops, the sampling of soil was performed. Five 
soil cores (0.30 cm depth) were taken in the middle part of each plot and then pooled together for 
the physic-chemical characterization analysis. The collected soil samples were air dried and sieved 
(<2 mm). The total organic carbon (TOC) and the total nitrogen (TN) contents of the soil samples were 
determined using an elementary analyzer (Thermo Soil NC - Flash EA1112, Lakewood, NJ, USA). 
Moreover, soil NO3-N [20] and soil NH4-N [21] concentrations were determined after soil sampling in 
an aliquot of sieved fresh soil in order to assess the soil mineral nitrogen. 
In both growing cycles, at the emergence of agro-ecological service crops, soil CO2 emissions 
were measured in each plot on a daily basis until their mechanical suppression using a portable 
dynamic closed-chamber infrared gas analyzer system [22]. All soil CO2 emission measurements were 
carried out at the same time of day in order to reduce diurnal variation and performed by placing 
the closed-chamber of a sensitive infrared gas analyzer instrument (EGM-4, PP Systems, Stotfold, 
UK) in a permanent PVC collar in the central plot of each agro-ecological service crop. Further 
information regarding the operation methods adopted for the CO2 measurements are reported by 
Mancinelli et al. [5]. The measured CO2 emission suggested the net carbon mineralization value. 
In both growing cycles, soil CO2 emission was estimated as the amount of C-CO2 accumulated [14,23] 
throughout the study period. The calculations were made by means of the linear interpolation of 
the two neighboring measured emissions and the numerical integration over time (trapezoid rule) as 
reported in the following equation: 
CO2 .. C = 
nai
[(x i + xi+1) N 2] + . . . + [(x n..1 + xn) N 2] (2) 
where i = date of first measurement of CO2 rate taken, n = date of last measurement of CO2 rate 
taken; x = CO2 rate (kg ha..1 day..1), and N = number of days between the two consecutive CO2 
rate measurements. 
The soil respiration index was estimated as soil C stock/soil CO2 emission rate (t ha..1/t ha..1). 
The soil C content was calculated by applying the formula suggested by Batjes [24]. Carbon 
input/output ratio was calculated as the ratio between the C added to the system by cover crop biomass 
at their termination (C input) and the total C content in the CO2 emissions measured throughout 
the growing season of the service crops [5]. Soil temperature close to the chamber was measured 
simultaneously to the measurement of CO2 emissions at a depth of 5 cm by using the STP-1 Soil 
Temperature Probe connected to an EGM-4 instrument. Similarly, soil volume water content was 
measured near the chamber at the same time of CO2 measurement at a depth of 30 cm using the TDR 
300 Soil Moisture Meter (Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Plainfield, IL, USA). 
2.4. Statistical Analysis 
The data on agro-ecological service crops and soil were analyzed with analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) using JMP statistical software package, version 4.0 [25]. The data analysis was carried 
out applying a randomized block design with three blocks and two years of experimentation. Data 
were analyzed using the ANOVA model with the treatment as fixed factor, the three blocks were 
included as a random factor and the year (growing cycle) was considered as random effect to account 
for the repeated measure across time [26]. Percentage data were arcsin transformed before analysis 
in order to homogenize the variance [27]. The data reported in the tables were back transformed for 
meaningful data interpretation. Fisher¡¯s protected least significant difference (LSD) at 0.05 probability 
level (p < 0.05) was used for comparing the treatments. Data on the FiPPFD, CO2 emissions, soil 
temperature and soil volume water content are presented as the means value  standard error (SE).

3.2. The fraction of PPFD Intercepted (FiPPFD) during the Agro-Ecological Service Crop Growing Cycle 
The fraction of photosynthetic photon flux density intercepted (FiPPFD) from the emergence to 
mechanical suppression of the agro-ecological service crop in 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 is reported in 
Figure 1. In both growing cycles, the values of FiPPDF in the agro-ecological service crops increased 
gradually in time, however, this trend was different among the treatments. Indeed, the first stages of 
the agro-ecological service crops immediately after their germination until to January, when it was 
observed the lowest soil temperature, the values of FiPPDF were generally similar and higher in oat 
and oilseed rape, while hairy vetch grew more slowly showing lower values of FiPPDF compared to 
oat and oilseed rape (Figure 1). Subsequently, the FiPPDF values in oilseed rape tended to decrease 
notably, while in hairy vetch they increased considerably and reached similar values observed in oat 
(Figure 1).

3.3. Soil CO2 Emissions during the Agro-Ecological Service Crop Growing Cycle 
The trends of soil CO2 emissions dynamics, throughout growing period of the agro-ecological 
service crops are shown in Figure 2. Generally, during the growing period the four adopted treatments 
affected soil CO2 emissions with a similar trend in both years. In fact, the CO2 flux tended to increase 
immediately after agro-ecological service crop emergence until December, when it was observed low 
soil temperature (Figure 2). After the cold days in each year, the soil CO2 flux tended to increase 
gradually in all treatments reaching a high value in April, just before the agro-ecological service crop 
suppression. In both years, few differences among the treatments until February were observed, while 
in the following months the trend of soil CO2 fluxes among the agro-ecological service crop treatments 
were largely different. In particular, the main differences were observed between hairy vetch and the 
other treatments in the 2009/2010 growing cycle, and between hairy vetch and oat compared to oilseed 
rape and bare soil in the 2010/2011 growing cycle.

high rainfall period and when all treatments showed similar value of soil volume water content. In 
the 2010/2011 growing period, a high value of soil volume water content in the hairy vetch treatment 
was observed, even if only in April, a high difference among the treatments was observed.

3.6. Agro-Ecological Service Crop Biomass and Soil Characteristics 
The total biomass, leaf/stem ratio (L/S), shoot/root ratio (S/R), N, and C accumulated in the total 
biomass of the agro-ecological service crop measured at their suppression are reported in Table 1. 
Total agro-ecological service crop biomass was significantly higher in the first year than the second 
year (averaged 919.7 vs. 695.5 g m.2 of dry matter (DM) in 2009/2010 and 2010/2011, respectively). 
The hairy vetch showed highest biomass production (on average of 1140.2 g m.2 DM), the oat 
resulted in intermediate value (on average of 763.8 g m.2 DM), and the amount of total biomass 
measured in oilseed rape was the lowest (on average of 518.8 g m.2 DM). Similarly, the leaf/stem 
ratio (L/S) was higher in hairy vetch and oat than oilseed rape (on average of 1.8 vs. 0.9, 
respectively), while no differences were observed between the growing cycles. Conversely, oilseed 
rape showed the highest value of shoot/root ratio (3.4). The nitrogen accumulated in the total 
biomass of the agro-ecological service crops at the time of their suppression was higher in hairy 
vetch than in oilseed rape and oat (on average of 33.1 vs. 7.1 g m.2, respectively, Table 1). At the same 
time, the C accumulated in the aboveground biomass was highest in hairy vetch, intermediate in oat 
and low in oilseed rape (476.6, 336.1, and 218.9 g m.2, respectively). The C/N ratio of the 
agro-ecological service crops was highest in oat, followed by oilseed rape and hairy vetch (data not 
shown).

3.6. Agro-Ecological Service Crop Biomass and Soil Characteristics 
The total biomass, leaf/stem ratio (L/S), shoot/root ratio (S/R), N, and C accumulated in the 
total biomass of the agro-ecological service crop measured at their suppression are reported in Table 1. 
Total agro-ecological service crop biomass was significantly higher in the first year than the second 
year (averaged 919.7 vs. 695.5 g m..2 of dry matter (DM) in 2009/2010 and 2010/2011, respectively). 
The hairy vetch showed highest biomass production (on average of 1140.2 g m..2 DM), the oat resulted 
in intermediate value (on average of 763.8 g m..2 DM), and the amount of total biomass measured 
in oilseed rape was the lowest (on average of 518.8 g m..2 DM). Similarly, the leaf/stem ratio (L/S) 
was higher in hairy vetch and oat than oilseed rape (on average of 1.8 vs. 0.9, respectively), while no 
differences were observed between the growing cycles. Conversely, oilseed rape showed the highest 
value of shoot/root ratio (3.4). The nitrogen accumulated in the total biomass of the agro-ecological 
service crops at the time of their suppression was higher in hairy vetch than in oilseed rape and oat 
(on average of 33.1 vs. 7.1 g m..2, respectively, Table 1). At the same time, the C accumulated in the 
aboveground biomass was highest in hairy vetch, intermediate in oat and low in oilseed rape (476.6, 
336.1, and 218.9 g m..2, respectively). The C/N ratio of the agro-ecological service crops was highest in 
oat, followed by oilseed rape and hairy vetch (data not shown).

As expected, the TOC was similar among growing cycles and the agro-ecological service crops (on 
average 1.24%). The mineral nitrogen in the soil was higher in 2009/2010 than in 2010/2011, while 
among the agro-ecological service crops, it was higher in hairy vetch than oilseed rape, bare soil, and 
oat (35.6, 22.0, 19.6 and 17.4 mg kg..1, respectively).

The soil C-CO2 emissions during the agro-ecological service crops were significantly higher 
in the first cycle than in the second (averagely 372 vs. 320 g C m..2 in 2009/2010 and 2010/2011, 
respectively), while among the agro-ecological service crops, the values recorded were highest in 
hairy vetch, intermediate in oat, and low in oilseed rape and bare soil (408, 355, and 312 g C m..2, 
respectively, Table 2). In 2009/2010, soil respiration index was higher than in 2010/2011. Hairy vetch 
showed the highest value of soil respiration index compared to the other agro-ecological service crops 
(0.094 vs. 0.077, respectively, Table 2). The input/output ratio of C was higher in hairy vetch (1.2), 
intermediate in oat (0.9) and oilseed rape (0.7), and low in bare soil (0.0, Table 2).

4. Discussion 
In this study, the effects of the cultivation of different agro-ecological service crops under 
Mediterranean climate conditions on short-term carbon balance, soil characteristics, and biomass 
production were evaluated throughout the growing cycle until their mechanical suppression before 
the preparation of the transplanting bed of the following main summer vegetable crop. To date, 
few studies have focused on the effect of agro-ecological service crops on CO2 fluxes in agricultural 
soils [28], especially during their growing cycle. In fact, as observed by Papp et al. [4], the majority of 
studies investigate the effects of agro-ecological service crops after their suppression and throughout 
the cultivation of the following cash crop when their residues where managed in different way, such 
as green manuring or mulching the soil. As a consequence, this approach evaluates the combined 
effects of agro-ecological service crop residues in terms of rhizo-depositions release due to species 
cultivation and of residue mineralization. Conversely, the approach adopted in this study is aimed to 
provide knowledge on changes due to the cultivation of a specific agro-ecological service crop during 
its growth period. 
The plant species adopted in this study as agro-ecological service crops were representative of 
cereal (oat), legume (hairy vetch), and cruciferous (oilseed rape) species, and were chosen because 
they are common and suitable for the cultivation in the temperate climate of the Mediterranean 
environment. Although the seedling emergence and establishment were uniform and regular among 
the three agro-ecological service crops, without any evident gaps, their canopy development followed 
different trends due to their inherent growth patterns and responses to the weather conditions. Indeed, 
based on the data regarding the FiPPDF, oat and oilseed rape showed a rapid establishment and growth 
compared to hairy vetch, resulting in high soil cover and, thus, in biomass production, especially 
during the first steps after their sowing. Conversely, soil coverage in hairy vetch was slow and started 
to grow rapidly only after the cold period reaching, before mechanical suppression, a complete soil 
coverage similar to oat (FiPPDF = 1). The results of this study confirmed that hairy vetch and oat could 
be well-suited plant species for their cultivation as agro-ecological service crops, in the temperate 
climate of the Mediterranean environment [3,5,18]. In fact, they were frost resistant and produced the 
highest amount of total biomass (shoots + roots), thus their cultivation could be encouraged in the 
Mediterranean environment, even if oat, as grass species, should be preferable for reducing nitrogen 
leaching risk [29] or suppress winter weeds [18], while hairy vetch, as legume species, should be 
suggested for its ability to fix high amount of atmospheric nitrogen and enhancing its availability after 
the suppression in a sustainable way throughout mineralization process [19]. Conversely, oilseed rape 
that grew fast after seeding was partly damaged (data not shown) by the winter frost, as shown 
by the FiPPDF data, and provided low amount of total biomass at the suppression. Similarly, 
Mancinelli et al. [5], in a previous study, observed high sensibility of cruciferous species to cold 
season in a similar environment. Furthermore, the data on leaf/stem ratio showed a higher number of 
leaves in hairy vetch and oat compared to oilseed rape, meaning a different canopy structure, mainly 
composed by materials more suitable to convert, after the mechanical suppression, in organic mulches, 
especially in the case of the adoption of conservation agriculture practices, as confirmed by the results 
reported by Mancinelli et al. [5] and Radicetti et al. [19] in similar environmental conditions. 
In both growing cycles, the flux of CO2 emissions follows similar trend among the agro-ecological 
service crops and tended to decrease during the cold period, then gradually increased until April 
when warm temperatures were observed. Similarly, Lal et al. [16] showed a gradual decrease of soil 
CO2 emissions from summer to winter and an increase of soil emissions with the hotter temperature. 
According to Jacinthe et al. [30], soil CO2 emissions strongly depend on weather conditions, indeed, 
the differences among the agro-ecological crop species were low and follow the soil temperature 
trend. However, the high biomass production in hairy vetch with low shoot/root ratio compared 
to oat and oilseed rape resulted in high and denser root biomass thus increasing microbial activity 
near to the soil surface [4]. As a consequence, rhizosphere and root respiration probably contributed 
significantly to the high soil CO2 emission values observed in hairy vetch, even if considering the

Agriculture 2019, 9, 71 11 of 13 
high amount of carbon accumulated on hairy vetch biomass, the input/output ratio resulted more 
favorable terms of carbon sink. However, the high soil CO2 emissions and respiration index observed 
in hairy vetch was probably due to an intensive microbial activity that began to decompose the organic 
material from soil and plant residues. As a consequence, mineral nutrients, especially nitrogen, became 
more available in the soil compared to oat and oilseed rape. Although the soil CO2 emissions and 
respiration index in oat and oilseed rape were significantly low compared hairy vetch, the carbon 
accumulated in their biomass determined a low input/output ratio and thus less efficient in term of 
carbon sink. These results confirmed that the cultivation of agro-ecological service crops, especially 
hairy vetch, could be adopted as a suitable strategy for enhancing short-term carbon dynamic and, 
thus, could contribute to the climate change mitigation if integrated in an integrated management 
strategy [31]. Furthermore, maximizing organic matter inputs, as observed in hairy vetch, could 
represent a way to add carbon to the soil (carbon sink) that could be a key factor for improving crop 
yields and reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers in agreement with Aguilera et al. [32], even if 
the addition of easily mineralizable carbon from agro-ecological crop residues could results in high 
CO2 emissions throughout the cultivation of the following main summer crop in agreement with 
Bodner et al. [33]. However, as stated by Mancinelli et al. [5,14] the soil tillage practice adopted for 
managing the residues of agro-ecological service crops represents an important factor that could affect 
the C balance in the agro-ecosystems. 
5. Conclusions 
In this study, the replacement of bare soil with agro-ecological service crops during the 
fallow period under Mediterranean climate represents a sustainable practice for improving carbon 
sequestration and contribute to mitigate CO2 emissions, even if the responses varied among the cover 
crops species. In fact, hairy vetch accumulated the largest amount of total biomass and carbon (input), 
also resulting in a better performance when soil CO2 emissions (output) were considered. Furthermore, 
the high amount of nitrogen accumulated in the total biomass of hairy vetch during the growing cycle 
assured an elevate availability for the following cash crop through mineralization process. Although 
oat was less efficient in terms of C end N soil accumulation than hairy vetch, the biomass produced 
and the carbon sequestered encourages the adoption of legumes in Mediterranean environment, even 
if the adoption of oat should be well evaluated because could sensibly reduce soil nitrogen availability. 
Conversely, the adoption of oilseed rape seems unable to cover the need to accumulate carbon on its 
biomass, due to the risk of frost damage especially in the winter when is frequent in the Mediterranean 
environment. However, further research should be performed for evaluating the adoption of this 
species for other agro-ecological service.
