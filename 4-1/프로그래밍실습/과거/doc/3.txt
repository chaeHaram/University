Abstract: Background: The present study investigated the effectiveness of stimulation applied at 
cervical levels on pain and Parkinson¡¯s disease (PD) symptoms using either tonic or burst stimulation 
mode. Methods: Tonic high cervical spinal cord stimulation (T-HCSCS) was applied on six PD 
patients suffering from low back pain and failed back surgery syndrome, while burst HCSCS 
(B-HCSCS) was applied in twelve PD patients to treat primarily motor deficits. Stimulation was 
applied percutaneously with quadripolar or octapolar electrodes. Clinical evaluation was assessed 
by the Unified Parkinson¡¯s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. 
Pain was evaluated by a visual analog scale. Evaluations of gait and of performance in a cognitive 
motor task were performed in some patients subjected to B-HCSCS. One patient who also suffered 
from severe autonomic cardiovascular dysfunction was investigated to evaluate the effectiveness of 
B-HCSCS on autonomic functions. Results: B-HCSCS was more effective and had more consistent 
effects than T-HCSCS in reducing pain. In addition, B-HCSCS improved UPDRS scores, including 
motor sub-items and tremor and H&Y score. Motor benefits appeared quickly after the beginning 
of B-HCSCS, in contrast to long latency improvements induced by T-HCSCS. A slight decrease of 
effectiveness was observed 12 months after implantation. B-HCSCS also improved gait and ability of 
patients to correctly perform a cognitive.motor task requiring inhibition of a prepared movement. 
Finally, B-HCSCS ameliorated autonomic control in the investigated patient. Conclusions: The results 
support a better usefulness of B-HCSCS compared to T-HCSCS in controlling pain and specific aspects 
of PD motor and non-motor deficits for at least one year.

1. Introduction 
Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a well-established neuromodulatory therapy [1] for the treatment 
of neuropathic pain. Its rationale is based on the gate theory of pain, according to which, activation 
of myelinated large sensory fibers in the dorsal columns inhibits transmission of nociceptive signals 
carried by unmyelinated small fibers at the level of the dorsal horn [2.5]. 
Since its first application, SCS has undergone a profound evolution of tools, devices, and surgical 
procedures, and its field of application has been recently extended to various motor disorders and 
other pathologies [6.8]. 
Motor symptoms in Parkinson¡¯s disease (PD) and PD animal models have been found to improve 
under SCS, and it has been reported that this treatment may also preserve nigrostriatal dopaminergic 
neurons from 6-hydroxydopamine-induced degeneration in rodents [9.20]. 
Most of the above clinical studies have been carried out by stimulating the spinal cord at thoracic 
levels. High cervical SCS (HCSCS) has been successfully introduced to manage pain from associated 
dermatomes (i.e., head, upper limbs, neck, and shoulders). 
In 2010, we first described the acute clinical effects of tonic HCSCS (T-HCSCS) on motor functions 
in PD patients implanted at cervical levels to treat neuropathic pain [21]. That study did not provide 
evidence of significant acute improvements in all of the motor assessments performed. Thereafter, other 
authors reported heterogeneous and controversial effects on PD motor symptoms in investigations 
mainly based on thoracic SCS [13,22]. 
Because of these heterogeneous effects, different stimulation parameters and stimulation 
modalities have been applied in order to optimize stimulation, obtain the best clinical outcome, 
and minimize the paresthesias that often are associated with tonic stimulation. Among the stimulation 
modalities, burst stimulation (i.e., by delivering trains of high-frequency stimuli) has provided better 
pain relief without causing disabling paresthesias compared to tonic stimulation [23.34]. 
Given these results, in the present study, we investigated acute and long-term effects (i.e., after a 
12-month follow-up) of HCSCS on motor and non-motor symptoms in PD patients and compared the 
effectiveness of T-HCSCS vs. burst HCSCS (B-HCSCS). 
The study has been conducted mainly through conventional clinical evaluations. Some patients 
subjected to B-HCSCS were also assessed for gait and performance in a cognitive sensorimotor task. 
Finally, a patient affected by atypical parkinsonism who also suffered from severe autonomic disorder 
was studied to assess the effectiveness of B-HCSCS in improving autonomic cardiovascular control. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Ethics Approval 
The study was approved by the local Ethics and human subject research committee, and a written 
informed consent was signed by all patients. 
2.2. Patients 
Eighteen patients suffering from PD or atypical parkinsonism who completed a one-year 
follow-up following implantation were enrolled in the study. Their demographic and clinical 
characteristics are reported in Table 1. 
PD patients in Group I (6 males) were selected for T-HCSCS to treat mainly neuropathic low back 
pain, failed back surgery syndrome, or vascular pain. Camptocormia was present in two of these 
patients. They were aged 71.1  7.3 years with disease duration of 17.1  6.1 years.

Brain Sci. 2019, 9, 78 3 of 17 
PD patients in Group II (10 males and 2 females) underwent B-HCSCS to treat exclusively 
parkinsonian motor symptoms (i.e., tremor, rigidity, gait and posture disturbances). Camptocormia 
was present in one of these patients and pain in four patients. Criteria for including patients in Group 
II were the presence of other pathologies besides PD, ineligibility for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) 
of basal ganglia targets, ineffectiveness of subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS (one patient), or decay of 
pedunculopontine nucleus DBS benefit (two patients). These patients were aged 65.6  11.1 years and 
disease duration was 11.1  5.3 years.

2.3. Surgical Procedure 
Surgery was performed in the ASL RM2 Regional Center for Functional Neurosurgery and DBS, 
Operative Unit of Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery at the CTO Alesini Hospital in Rome in 
the period from April 2009 to December 2017. Local analgesia was employed in thirteen patients, and 
general anesthesia in five patients, depending on the patient¡¯s conditions. Of the six patients in Group I, 
five were implanted with a quadripolar electrode (mod. 3487-A, Medtronic ND, Minneapolis, MI, USA) 
and one with an octapolar electrode (Pisces-Octad mod. 3898, Medtronic ND, Minneapolis, MI, USA). 
All patients in Group II were implanted with an MRI-compatible octapolar electrode (Octrode, St. 
Jude-Abbott, Austin, TX, USA). 
A pulse generator was applied to patients two weeks after electrode implantation. During 
these two weeks, the electrodes were externalized and connected to an external programmer to 
evaluate the acute effects of stimulation and ascertain that no unwanted effects occurred. For these 
aims, a Synergy Versitrel device (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MI, USA) was used in Group I patients, 
while a Prodigy current constant device (St. Jude Medical, St.Paul, MI, USA) was used in Group II 
patients. During external temporary stimulation, the acute effects of both T-HCSCS and B-HCSCS 
were assessed in Group II patients in successive sessions, and the current threshold for the appearance 
of paresthesias was established in each patient. The most useful pairs of stimulation contacts and the 
correct positioning of the electrode, as postoperatively verified by X-ray, are shown in Figure 1.

2.4. Stimulation Parameters and Clinical Evaluations 
The pair of stimulation contacts providing the best clinical outcome was searched in each 
patient, and optimal stimulation parameters (frequency, pulse duration, current amplitude, or 
intensity) were determined (Table 2). Adjustments of current levels were made in the course of the 
follow-up to assure the constancy of clinical outcome. Patients in Group I had the possibility to 
modify by themselves one of the three stimulation parameters (i.e., frequency or pulse duration or 
current intensity), within a range previously established by physicians, as they felt a decline of the 
efficacy of stimulation. Patients in Group II also had the possibility to modify the pair of active 
contacts according to preprogrammed combinations. The number of adjustments made by both 
physicians and patients was considered an index of the stability of stimulation efficacy. Pain was 
evaluated through a visual analog scale (VAS). Clinical examination was performed preoperatively, 
2 days after beginning of stimulation (acute evaluation) and 3, 6, and 12 months later. For this aim, 
the Unified Parkinson¡¯s Disease Scale (UPDRS) III, sub-item 16 (tremor), sub-items 27.31 (arising 
from chair, posture, gait, postural stability, and body bradykinesia and hypokinesia), the Hoehn 
and Yahr (H&Y) scale, and the VAS were evaluated in the conditions of stimulation-OFF/drug-ON 
and stimulation-ON/drug-ON. The condition of stimulation-OFF/drug-ON was investigated after 
switching off stimulation for 48 h. Drug therapy for PD was never suspended for ethical reasons, 
and the daily dose of L-Dopa (mg/day) was modified in the course of the follow-up according to 
patients¡¯ responsiveness to stimulation. 
Patients in Group II underwent the same general procedures as Group I patients. They began 
to receive stimulation 2 days after electrode implantation. Stimulation was applied in the tonic 
modality in the first two days to establish the current threshold for the appearance of paresthesias. 
Then, stimulation was switched to the burst modality, i.e., at a burst rate of 40 Hz, intraburst rate of 
500 Hz, pulse width of 1000 ¥ìs, and current intensity of 0.5 ¡¾ 0.2 mA. When starting burst 
stimulation, the current intensity was set at 80% of the threshold for the appearance of paresthesias. 
During the follow-up, the current intensity was reduced up to 60% of the threshold for paresthesias 
in most patients.

the current intensity was set at 80% of the threshold for the appearance of paresthesias. During 
the follow-up, the current intensity was reduced up to 60% of the threshold for paresthesias in 
most patients.

2.5. Instrumental Evaluation of Gait 
Instrumental analysis of gait was carried out in eight patients (four in Group I and four in Group 
II) who manifested willingness to undergo the procedure for gait analysis. This was done 6 months 
after beginning of stimulation. Spatiotemporal parameters of gait were investigated in conditions 
of either stimulation OFF or stimulation ON, and always under medication, according to methods 
described previously [35,36]. Four height-, weight-, and age-matched male subjects served as controls. 
2.6. Cognitive Motor Task 
Three patients in Group II who manifested willingness to undergo a stop-signal (SS) behavioral 
task were assessed for their motor abilities in a motor-related cognitive task in the first days 
following surgery when the electrodes were still externalized. These patients were selected since, 
in addition to motor symptoms, they clearly showed clinical signs of slowing of motor initiation 
during neurological examination. The SS task has been widely used to evaluate the involvement of 
cortical and subcortical brain regions on the cognitive control of movement in normal subjects and 
patients [37.40]. The inhibitory control of acts and thoughts is part of the executive functions managed 
by the prefrontal cortex in cooperation with many other cortical and subcortical regions, primarily the 
basal ganglia [41].

During the experiments, the patients were seated in a dimly lit room, with their eyes 45 cm 
from a standard PC monitor (cathode-ray tube not interlaced, rate 85 Hz). The presentation of visual 
stimuli and data acquisition w under the control of the freeware Psychtoolbox software ver. 3.0 
(psychtoolbox.org) operating under MatLab (www.matworks.com). A joystick, aligned to the body 
midline, was connected to a Universal Serial Bus computer port and used to measure motor parameters. 
In the task (Figure 2), the subjects were instructed to respond in most of the trials with a directed 
motor action on the joystick in the direction indicated by the Go signal (arrow). In selected trials, 
a Stop signal (SS, red square) replaced the Go signal during the reaction time (RT) after a variable stop 
signal delay (SSD) instruction in order to cancel the programmed movement. Trials with successfully 
suppressed movements were classified as stop-correct, while trials with movements executed after a 
SS presentation were classified as stop-error. 
A staircase procedure was used to select the SSD in each stop trial. The SSD was increased by 
50 ms after each stop-correct trial and decreased by 50 ms after each stop-error trial. The procedure 
automatically adapted the SSD duration to subject performance to obtain a session probability of 
stop-error that approximates 0.5, and that was similar between patients. The RT distribution and the 
relationship between the different SSDs used and the corresponding probability of success allowed us 
to obtain an estimate of the efficiency of the inhibitory process (SS reaction time, SSRT) [41]. 
All these task-specific, behaviorally relevant variables were studied in the phase in which 
B-HCSCS was applied through the externalized electrode, i.e., before the final procedure to connect the 
electrode to the subcutaneous stimulator. The task was investigated under stimulation in the morning 
(ON condition) and 30.40 min after switching off the stimulator in the afternoon (OFF condition). 
Blocks of 100 trials were employed (3 blocks per patient in ON condition and 3 in OFF condition, total 
trials: 300 in ON condition and 300 in OFF condition; percentage: Stop 30% and Go 70%). All patients 
showed motivation and fully collaborated during the experimental sessions. Three age-matched 
subjects served as controls.

2.7. Autonomic Function Evaluation 
One patient in Group II who was affected by atypical parkinsonism (multiple system atrophy) 
and showed severe cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction was investigated to assess to what extent 
B-HCSCS could improve autonomic responses. This was done according to principles, methods, and 
materials described elsewhere [42.44]. 
In brief, the sympathetic nervous system was assessed by recording blood pressure responses 
to the head-up tilt test (HUTT), the Valsalva maneuver, and the handgrip test. The parasympathetic 
cardiovagal function was assessed by recording heart rate variation during deep breathing and 
Valsava maneuver. 
2.8. Statistic Analysis 
Clinical data were evaluated using Friedman nonparametric ANOVAs, and theWilcoxon test was 
used for pairwise comparisons. Gait and cognitive data were analyzed using a nonparametric ANOVA 
design, and pairwise comparisons were performed using the Mann.Whitney test, with Bonferroni¡¯s 
adjusted p-values if required. Type I error was set at p < 0.05. The Statistica ver. 8.0 software package 
(Statsoft, Tulsa, OK, USA) was used. Values are reported as means  SD. 
3. Results 
No complications occurred during electrode implantation and in the follow-up period. 
The electrode tip was located at C2 level in sixteen patients and at C2.C3 in two patients (Figure 1) 
3.1. T-HCSCS (Group I Patients) 
The best clinical outcome was obtained by delivering stimuli at rate of 150  27.2 Hz, pulse width 
93.3  58.5 s, and voltage of 3.0  0.9 V. The most useful contact pair was contact 2 as the cathode 
and contact 3 as the anode. These patients needed to vary the electrical parameters often to maintain 
the efficacy of stimulation, and a mean of 17.6  5.7 modifications were made every three months in 
the follow-up period. 
As shown in Figures 3 and 4, stimulation required three months of application to induce significant 
improvement in UPDRS evaluations, including sub-items 27.31, except in one patient, in whom a 
prompt improvement of motor disabilities was observed switching on stimulation the day after 
implantation. This benefit was still present at 12 months post-implantation. In agreement with this 
result, the daily dose of L-Dopa could be reduced from the preoperative value of 1333.3  471.9 mg to 
1083.3  264.0 mg at 12 months. 
The H&Y score also required three months of stimulation to show a reduction. This benefit 
declined at 12 months but remained at significant levels compared to the preoperative values. 
Concerning pain, the VAS score showed a significant reduction up to the ninth month of stimulation 
and, therefore, the administration of analgesics could be reduced. This effect lasted until 12 months 
post-implantation, when pain returned to preoperative level. 
The motor improvements that could be appreciated upon clinical examination were also supported 
by the results of instrumental evaluation as many of the of gait parameters, such as cadence, step 
length, and stride length, which significantly ameliorated during stimulation (Figure 5).

3.2. B-HCSCS (Group II Patients) 
The best clinical motor outcome was obtained by delivering bursts at 40 Hz, with each burst 
composed of five 1 ms pulses delivered at 500 Hz and at 0.5  0.2 mA current intensity. 
Among the combinations of active contacts that could be selected in the octapolar electrode, 
contacts two, four, and five used as the cathode and contacts three and six as the anode gave the best 
clinical result. The number of adjustments of the electrical parameters that these patients required every 
three months was significantly lower than in Group I patients (3.9  0.9 vs. 17.6  5.6, p < 0.05), and the 
intensity of the stimulation current could be reduced up to 60% of the level that produced paresthesias. 
As shown in Figures 3 and 4, efficacy of stimulation developed soon after the beginning of 
stimulation, lasted until the end of the follow-up, and was more effective than T-HCSCS. The higher 
efficacy of B-HCSCS vs. T-HCSCS was still present at 12 months, although at a lesser extent compared 
to previous UPDRS evaluations. 
Sub-item 27.31 scores showed a significant improvement in gait and motor abilities that 
was maintained at 12 months post-implantation. This effect was more effective compared to the 
effect of T-HCSCS, but from the sixth month onward, there was no difference between the two 
stimulation modalities. 
The H&Y score already decreased at the first evaluation after beginning of stimulation and 
remained at values similar to those recorded in T-HCSCS during the follow-up, to ultimately decline 
at 12 months. 
Tremor decreased significantly after beginning of stimulation and was still significantly reduced 
at 12 months, although to a lesser extent. In line with the improvement of motor disabilities, the daily 
dose of L-Dopa could be reduced from the preoperative value of 835.0  310.1 mg to 730  273.7 mg 
at 12 months. 
The B-HCSCS effect did not improve camptocormia in the patients that manifested this postural 
deformity. Concerning pain, it was significantly and consistently reduced throughout the follow-up 
(not shown); consequently, a lower number of analgesic drugs were administered than in the

Brain Sci. 2019, 9, 78 11 of 17 
preoperative condition. The maximal efficacy of B-HCSCS in reducing pain compared to T-HCSCS 
was reached at 12 months post-implantation. 
As shown in Figure 5, the instrumental spatiotemporal analysis of gait provided objective data 
supporting the improvement of gait suggested by the clinical evaluation of UPDRS 27.31 motor 
sub-items. In general, these patients showed better basic parameters, likely because of their younger 
age compared to Group I patients. As it occurred with tonic stimulation, gait parameters improved, 
although never reaching values of age-matched healthy controls. Cadence, step length, and stride 
length increased significantly, while gait speed, step width, speed swing, percent of stance, and percent 
of double support improved but did not reach levels of significance compared to prestimulation values. 
3.3. Cognitive.Motor Task 
All subjects performed in the stop-signal task as required, suggesting that they were able to 
adequately follow the provided instructions. The behavioral adhesion to the race model previsions was 
controlled before computing the SSRT through the integration method [45]. For this aim, we controlled 
that the mean stop-error RT in each subject was significantly lower than the mean Go trials RT (paired-t 
test). We also controlled for an increase of the stop-error RT with SSD duration. Regression analysis 
detected across subjects showed a significant linear increase of the stop-error RT with the SSD (not 
shown). 
As shown in Figure 6, RT and SSRT were significantly higher in PD patients compared to controls. 
In patients, spinal stimulation reduced only the duration of the SSRT, while it did not affect the RT.

4. Discussion 
Stimulation of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord at thoracic levels has been initially introduced 
to control neuropathic pain [3,4,11]. Given its effectiveness, stimulation has also been applied at 
cervical level for treating head, upper limbs, neck, and shoulder pain conditions. However, when 
applied in PD patients and PD animal models, spinal stimulation was also effective in reducing motor 
disturbances typical of this neurodegenerative disorder [10,15,18,19,22,46,47]. 
In our former experience [21], short-term effects of T-HCSCS, i.e., when stimulation was 
continuously applied to the upper cervical level 48 h after electrode implantation, were represented by 
reduction of pain, whereas akinesia and locomotion were not significantly improved. 
By contrast, long term effects of T-HCSCS showed that PD motor symptoms could be ameliorated 
and that these effects declined after several months of stimulation. Similar results were also reported 
in the literature [22]. 
The reduction of motor improvement varied from patient to patient, and frequent adjustments 
of stimulation parameters were required to maintain stimulation effectiveness. When an increase of 
current intensity was requested, patients suffered from paresthesias to the point that no further change 
could be made. The most parsimonious explanation of the loss of effectiveness of tonic stimulation 
over time is that adaptation to continuously applied stimuli developed. 
Given the above data, in the present study, we applied B-HCSCS in a larger group of PD patients 
who were not eligible for STN or globus pallidus DBS, or in which DBS had not provided satisfactory 
results, and we compared the effects of T-HCSCS with those induced by B-HCSCS. The latter mode 
of stimulation has been recently introduced in our practice in treating pain syndromes and revealed 
better effectiveness than T-HCSCS in providing a long-lasting relief and a better quality of life (QoL). 
While confirming our prior results, the present study revealed that there are important qualitative 
and quantitative differences in the effects induced by the two stimulating modalities. B-HCSCS-treated 
patients improved in UPDRS scores, including motor sub-items 27.31, within a few minutes after 
stimulation onset, and tremor was also reduced. These results were supported by improvements 
in gait performance and psychomotor abilities in some patients whom it was possible to enroll for 
instrumental analysis of gait and psychomotor capacity. The limits of the gait analysis and evaluation 
of psychomotor abilities that we present are due to the small cohort of patients enrolled and by the 
single evaluation that it has been possible to perform only at 5.6 months following stimulation. In spite 
of these limits, the collected results are worth consideration, given the overall results and conclusion 
of this study.

Brain Sci. 2019, 9, 78 13 of 17 
When delivering B-HCSCS, fewer changes to stimulation parameters were required throughout 
the follow-up than those required when using T-HCSCS. In addition, the current intensity could 
be reduced up to 60% of the threshold for paresthesias. These two factors, together with the lower 
amount of L-Dopa that was possible to administer, decreased the H&Y score and improved the patients¡¯ 
QoL. It should also be noted that the ability that patients had to change the stimulation current on 
their own when they felt that stimulation began to be ineffective should have minimized the issue 
of adaptation to stimuli, increasing the psychological confidence of the patient in the method and 
favoring a consistent clinical improvement over the follow-up period. 
Concerning the mechanism of action, the different clinical effects on pain and motor disabilities 
induced by the two types of stimulation and the different time-course of their effects provide further 
support to the hypothesis that B-HCSCS and T-SCSCS may act through different spinal and supraspinal 
mechanisms [23,26,48], neurotransmitters, and neuroactive substances [48,49]. 
The results that we have obtained with tonic stimulation are fully in agreement with those reported 
by Pinto de Souza and co-workers, who found 50% to 65% improvement in gait measurements and 
35% to 40% in UPDRS III and QoL scores after stimulating the spinal cord at thoracic levels in four 
PD patients resistant to STN DBS [18]. In addition, our study provides clinical and instrumental data 
supporting better and long-lasting effectiveness of burst stimulation compared to tonic stimulation 
of the upper segments of the cervical cord. Such benefits were also observed in patients affected by 
atypical parkinsonisms. 
The positive effects that we report by applying stimulation at high cervical levels, i.e., at a level 
closer to brainstem structures compared to the more distant thoracic levels, suggest that cervical 
stimulation, in addition to modulating the activity of dorsal column and dorsal horn elements involved 
in pain control, may also act by modulating the activity of motor and vegetative brainstem nuclei. 
In this regard, it should be also emphasized that the most caudal contact of the stimulating 
electrode was used as the cathode of the active contacts pair, while the anode was chosen among the 
remaining contacts. This means that the current flow was always directed toward structures located in 
the upper cervical segments and overlying brainstem. 
Further support for this assumption stems from the improvement of autonomic control on 
cardiovascular functions induced by B-HCSCS in the patient suffering from atypical parkinsonism, 
who also suffered from a severe autonomic cardiovascular dysfunction. Despite the limitations 
that a single case study may have, the results from this patient are in agreement with the possible 
involvement of brainstem nuclei in the mediation of HCSCS effects. Indeed, the brainstem, in addition 
to the dorsal column nuclei, includes both nuclei controlling autonomic functions and motor nuclei, 
such as the cuneiform and the pedunculopontine (PPN) nuclei. These latter nuclei are involved in both 
motor and non-motor functions, and their DBS has been shown to improve gait and axial deficits in 
PD [35,36,50.52]. Another possibility is that stimulation may activate gamma oscillations in the PPN 
(~40 Hz), thus generating bottom.up gamma-inducing normal levels of activity [53]. 
B-HCSCS was also effective in improving the inhibitory control of an ongoing movement 
rather than reaction to an imperative signal for movement initiation. The reasons of this effect 
remain to be investigated, but, according to data in the literature, the frontal lobe [54.58] and the 
hyperdirect pathway, i.e., the cortico.subthalamic.pallidal pathway that mediates fast inhibition of 
movement [59,60], might play a role in such an effect. 
If one looks at the effects of acute application of B-HCSCS and DBS of basal ganglia nuclei, 
it appears that both these effects share a rapid onset. Assuming that B-HCSCS may influence basal 
ganglia machinery in the brainstem, it is reasonable to hypothesize that B-HCSCS and basal ganglia 
DBS may share some mechanisms [61.66]. 
Conversely, T-HCSCS, which requires a longer application time to be effective, might require 
additional changes in the nervous system that establish slowly, perhaps requiring long-latency action 
of neurotransmitters and neuroactive substances [67.69].

5. Conclusions 
B-HCSCS appears to be more effective than T-HCSCS in improving pain as well as motor 
disabilities and tremor in PD and atypical parkinsonisms at least after one year of application. These 
improvements may be associated with better cognitive performance and amelioration of autonomic 
control. The benefits of B-HCSCS appear to develop quickly and persist for a longer time compared 
to those induced by T-HCSCS. In addition, using the burst mode of stimulation, a better control of 
paresthesias may be obtained by reducing stimulation current and, at the same time, a better QoL may 
be provided to patients in reducing the daily L-Dopa administration. 
Further investigation in larger and homogeneous cohorts of patients and controls will help in the 
future to elucidate the functional consequences of B-HCSCS and their long-lasting time course.
