Abstract: Camellia spp., which are self-incompatible plants, are some of the most important woody 
species producing edible oil in Southeast Asian countries. However, the demand for camellia 
oil currently exceeds the supply due to low product yields that have resulted from a decrease in 
pollination services. Although Camellia osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera are cultivated in 
South China, little is known about the correspondence between pollinator abundance and pollinator 
services for this plant genus. In this study, the diversity, daily activity patterns, and pollination 
effectiveness of insects visiting C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis and C. oleifera were investigated. A total 
of 24 species, belonging to four orders and 11 families, of visiting insects were identified. Apis cerana 
cerana Fabricius, Vespa bicolor Fabricius, V. velutina Lepeletier, V. ducalis Smith, and Phytomia zonata 
Fabricius were the dominant pollinators. The daily activity peaks of the five visiting insects were 
between 10:00 and 14:00, which may have been related to the pattern of floral resource production 
(particularly nectar). Cross-pollination by insects significantly increased the fruit production rates of 
C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera. Therefore, the wild bees and flies that pollinate wild and 
cultivated Camellia plants should be protected in South China.

1. Introduction 
The fruit and seed set of many crops rely on pollination through a pollinator, especially by 
insects. Approximately 35% of global crop production arises from crop species that benefit from 
insect pollination [1]. As is well known, honey bees are the most ubiquitous and commonly used 
managed pollinator in the world. However, apart from a few managed bee taxa, the great majority of 
other pollinators (e.g., flies, moths, butterflies, and beetles) that are free-living or wild also provide an 
ecosystem service to crops [2,3]. Pollination involves interactions between two predominant groups of 
organisms: the flowering plants and the vectors of their gametes. Such interactions broadly comprise 
one of the most varied and widespread of all mutualistic relationships [4]. Generally, plants exhibit a 
remarkable diversity of floral traits that evolve in response to natural selection by a pollinator [5,6].

Therefore, a large number of studies have examined the effects of floral traits, including floral color, 
scent and nectar, flower number and size, corolla size, etc., on pollinator attraction [7]. For example, 
evidence was found that increases flower number and size cause increased visitation by syrphid 
flies [6,7]. Understanding the abundance and identity of insect flower visitors and floral traits on 
pollinator attraction is an important component in quantifying pollination within crops dependent on 
insect pollination [8]. 
Camellia spp., which are native to China, are some of the most economically important trees 
in Southeast Asian countries, as their seeds are used to produce edible tea oil [9]. Indeed, seeds of 
Camellia spp. have been utilized in China for more than 2000 years [10]. The unsaturated fatty acids 
content of Camellia spp. seeds exceeds 84%; therefore, the oil produced from these seeds has been 
recommended as a healthy edible oil by the Food and Agriculture Organization [11]. However, the 
demand for camellia oil currently exceeds the supply due to the low product yield that has resulted 
from a decrease in pollination services [12,13], and Camellia spp. reproduction is prevented by a 
shortage of effective pollinators in some regions, e.g., the plateau region of China [14]. Therefore, it is 
necessary to investigate pollinator abundance and the corresponding pollination services provided to 
Camellia to identify targets for conservation. 
Camellia osmantha Ye, Ma et Ye was first recorded in the city of Nanning in Guangxi and 
described in 2012 as a new species. Camellia osmantha is a small evergreen woody tree approximately 
4.8 m in height. The trees bloom from October to December [15]. Camellia vietnamensis Huang is 
widely cultivated in tropical and southern subtropical regions including Guangxi, Guangdong, and 
Hainan in China, as well as Vietnam and Thailand. Camellia vietnamensis blooms from November to 
January [16]. Camellia oleifera Abel is widely cultivated in South China as a commercial crop, and its 
seeds contain abundant edible oil [17]. Camellia oleifera blooms from October to January [18]. Camellia 
spp. are insect-pollinated plants, and their recorded insect visitors span five orders, 33 families, and 
130 species [13]. For example, in Guangxi Province, 19 families and 54 species of insect visitors of 
C. oleifera have been recorded [19,20]; in Hunan Province, six families and six species have been 
recorded [21]; and in Fujian Province, 11 families and 24 species have been recorded [22]. The fruit 
production rates of C. oleifera increase significantly after cross-pollination by insects. For example, the 
fruit production rates increased 2 to 4.5 times after cross-pollination by Colletes gigas Cockerell [23] 
and Apis cerana cerana Fabricius [24]. However, little is known about the correspondence between 
pollinator abundance and pollinator services for C. osmantha and C. vietnamensis. Such information 
will be helpful for improving Camellia spp. yield and protecting their pollinating insects. 
The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity, daily activity patterns and pollination 
effectiveness of the insects visiting C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Study Site 
This study was carried out at the Improved Variety and Cultivation Engineering Research Center 
of Oiltea Camellia of the Guangxi Forestry Research Institute (22130.23320 N, 107450.108510 E, 
230 m above sea level). Camellia osmantha (16,000.0 m2), C. vietnamensis (13,000.0 m2), and C. oleifera 
(20,000.0 m2) fields were selected. The trees were 4.6 years old, with heights ranging from 1.8.2.5 m 
and an average crown size of 2.1 m  2.0 m. Pesticides were not applied. 
2.2. The Diversity and Daily Activity of Insects Visiting C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera 
Insects visiting C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera were observed between 08:00 and 
18:00 during the period of flowering. Within each Camellia ssp. field, 20 trees were randomly 
observed for  30 min (excluding trees at field edges) on 23.24 November 2016, 10.11 January 
2017, and 22 December 2017. Data were pooled across the two flowering seasons, resulting in a total of 
~30 observation hours for 60 trees of C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera. All visiting insects

were first photographed with a professional single-lens reflex (SLR) camera (EOS 5D Mark II, Canon, 
of flowers visited, 
recorded hourly and pooled across the two sampling dates, resulting in a total of ~120 observation 
hours for 12 trees of C. osmantha, vietnamensis, and C. oleifera. 
2.3. Floral Traits of C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera 
To explore the potential effect of floral traits on attraction to pollinator visitation, a total of 
30 flowers from 10 trees (three flowers/tree) within each Camellia ssp. field were randomly selected to 
measure the diameter of the corolla, height, and diameter of the stamens, and height of the pistils with 
a Vernier caliper at their full-bloom stage (Figure 1).

Tokyo, Japan). Some species that were not identified in loco were collected using an insect net, and 
identification of the collected insects was performed using keys in the laboratory [25.27]. The total 
number of insects visiting C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera was recorded. 
Within each Camellia ssp. field, four trees were randomly observed between 08:00 and 18:00 on 
25.26 December 2017 and 10.11 January 2018. Floral visitors, including the number of flowers visited, 
were recorded hourly and pooled across the two sampling dates, resulting in a total of ~120 
observation hours for 12 trees of C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera. 
2.3. Floral Traits of C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera 
To explore the potential effect of floral traits on attraction to pollinator visitation, a total of 30 
flowers from 10 trees (three flowers/tree) within each Camellia ssp. field were randomly selected to 
measure the diameter of the corolla, height, and diameter of the stamens, and height of the pistils 
with a Vernier caliper at their full-bloom stage (Figure 1).

2.4. Nectar Volumes and Sugar Concentrations of C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera Flowers 
Nectar availability and sugar concentration were determined by sampling flowers at midday 
from plants within the area of pollinator counts. The nectar volume present in one flower was always 
too low to determine volume and sugar concentration on a per flower basis. Therefore, volume and 
concentration measurements were taken on pooled nectar samples from a number of flowers [28]. A 
total of 5.8 flowers per tree were collected for measurement to determine the dynamic changes of 
nectar volume and sugar concentration from the 1st (full-bloom stage) to the 5th day (end of 
blooming). Nectar volume was measured a calibrated micropipette (Rainin, New York, NY, USA) 
and concentration was measured with a hand saccharimeter (Atago, Tokyo, Japan). Three 
replications and a total of 111, 57, and 117 flowers were used for C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. 
oleifera measurements, respectively. 
2.5. Effect of Insect Pollination on the Fruit Production Rates of C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. 
oleifera 
To determine the pollination effectiveness of the insects, five trees of C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, 
and C. oleifera, respectively, were selected randomly in the fields. On each of the 15 trees, one branch 
was enclosed in a white nylon net cage (length¡¿ width ¡¿ height = 100 ¡¿ 100 ¡¿ 100 cm, mesh: 0.1 mm) 
before the onset of flowering to prevent pollination by insects (treatment group). Another branch of 
similar size at each tree was marked and left uncaged to allow pollination by insects (control group). 
The number of buds was recorded at all branches to calculate fruit production rates (number of 
fruits/number of buds ¡¿ 100%) per branch. The cages were removed after fruit had developed.

before the onset of flowering to prevent pollination by insects (treatment group). Another branch 
of similar size at each tree was marked and left uncaged to allow pollination by insects (control 
group). The number of buds was recorded at all branches to calculate fruit production rates (number 
of fruits/number of buds  100%) per branch. The cages were removed after fruit had developed.

2.6. Statistical Analyses 
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Species richness 
and total flower visitor abundance as well as abundance of dominant flower visitors were compared 
among C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera flowers by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), 
followed by Tukey¡¯s honest significant difference (HSD) test for multiple comparisons. The tendency 
of dominant flower visitors towards flower constancy was evaluated by comparing the percentage 
of visits of each dominant visiting insect to 1, 2, and 3 flower(s) on one Camellia tree by one-way 
ANOVA, followed by Tukey¡¯s HSD test for multiple comparisons. The diameter of the corolla, height 
and diameter of the stamens, height of the pistils, nectar volume, and sugar concentration were 
compared among C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera flowers by one-way ANOVA, followed by 
Tukey¡¯s HSD test for multiple comparisons. The fruit production rates were compared between the 
treatment group and the control group for C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera separately using 
a paired samples t-test. Proportional data were subjected to arcsine square root transformation prior to 
analysis. A level of p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant for all statistical analyses.

The sugar concentration of C. oleifera was significantly lower than those of C. osmantha and 
C. vietnamensis on the 1st day around florescence (F = 33.631, df = 28, p = 0.001) even though C. oleifera 
had a higher volume. Changes in sugar concentrations were similar to the changes in nectar volume 
(2nd, F = 5.416, df = 2,8, p = 0.045; 3rd, F = 27.821, df = 2,8, p = 0.001; 4th, F = 76.749, df = 2,8, p = 0.000) 
(Figure 4B). 
3.4. Effect of Insect Pollination on the Fruit Production Rates of C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera 
The fruit production rates of C. osmantha trees with branches that were enclosed in a net cage to 
prevent pollination by insects were significantly lower than those of the control (t = ..5.732, df = 4, 
p = 0.005). There same results were observed for C. vietnamensis (t = ..2.561, df = 4, p = 0.043) and 
C. oleifera (t = ..5.012, df = 4, p = 0.007) (Figure 5). Furthermore, fruit production rates of C. oleifera 
seems to fall in-between the other two species, if pollinators are present.

4. Discussion 
For C. oleifera, a total of 54 species of visiting insects, including 25 hymenopteran species, were 
recorded in Guangxi, South China [19,20]. Surprisingly little is known about the pollinator assemblages 
of C. osmantha and C. vietnamensis, although this information is crucial for ecological investigations 
of reproductive traits. In this study, a total of 24 species of visiting insects were identified in the field 
investigations, and the dominant insects visiting C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera included 
A. cerana cerana, V. bicolor, V. velutina, V. ducalis, and P. zonata. Although the visiting insects in this study 
were less abundant than those in previous reports, which may be relative to the geographical site and 
investigated method, the dominant species of visiting insects were consistent [19,20]. 
Three out of the five dominant common flower visitors to C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and 
C. oleifera, including the most dominant one, did not show a preference for one species. In contrast, 
V. bicolor and V. ducalis had an obvious preference for C. oleifera, although the sugar concentration of 
C. oleifera nectar was significantly lower than that of C. osmantha and C. vietnamensis nectar during 
flowering. Although nectar volumes in C. oleifera were higher than in C. osmantha, they did not differ 
from C. vietnamensis (Figure 4). Therefore, nectar production, which is the main source of energy for 
visiting insects, does not appear to be the only driver of flower preference. 
Similarly, C. vietnamensis produces larger flowers than the other Camellia species (Table 4), but was 
not visited more often by any flower visitor species. Usually, larger displays of flowers/inflorescences 
release more floral scents and are more visible than smaller displays, attracting more visiting insects [29]. 
This may be explained by the theory that floral and inflorescence traits evolved under a trade-off 
between visual and olfactory cues [30]. In fact, odor is an important cue for visiting insects, which is 
often influenced by a wide variety of volatile floral scent molecules [31]. These specific floral volatile 
organic compound mixtures attract specialist pollinators that have evolved an innate preference for 
them [32]. Whether the floral scent of C. oleifera consists of species-specific volatile organic compounds 
that attract visiting insects needs further study. 
Interestingly, the only dominant flower visitor species showing a clear pattern of flower constancy 
within a Camellia tree did not discriminate among subspecies (Table 3). In fact, flower constancy 
within trees was rare among dominant flower visitors, with three out of five species either visiting a 
single flower and leaving the tree afterwards or visiting a row of flowers consecutively. We considered 
that flower visitors leave an individual plant if resources are not sufficient in the flower [33] or the 
perception of scent marks deposited by previous visitors [34]. 
Many visiting insects show specific daily activity patterns [35]. In the current study, the daily 
activity of the five visiting insects occurred during the photophase, with clear peak visiting times 
from 10:00 to 14:00 (Figure 3). By timing anthesis and/or the presentation of floral rewards to match

Insects 2019, 10, 98 10 of 12 
the activity peaks of their most efficient pollinators, and thus to ensuring the best pollination service, 
plants might enhance their reproductive output via increased pollen transfer [28]. Therefore, the 
daily patterns of these visitor activities may be related to the pattern of floral resource production in 
C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera. A previous study showed that the average volume of nectar 
in flowers exposed to pollinators varied somewhat throughout the day, reaching a maximum around 
midday [28]. The daily change in nectar may explain the dynamics of the visiting insects¡¯ activity 
in this study. In fact, daily patterns of floral resource presentation, particularly nectar presentation, 
have been investigated in detail for many species, and these patterns have often been examined in 
relation to daily variations in pollinator activity [28,36,37]. We believe that flower visitors followed 
maximum nectar production either by experience or by spending more time on rewarding flowers, 
thereby increasing the detection probability. 
Camellia spp. are self-incompatible and show high fruit production rates after cross-pollination. 
There is also increasing evidence that cross-pollination by insects increases the fruit production rates 
of these species [21]. The data indicated that these dominant visiting insects play a very important role 
in the yield of C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera (Figure 5). In fact, flower thinning had no 
significant effects on fruit production rates, e.g., in C. osmantha (Table S1). Thus, our results support 
the view that cross-pollination by insects increases fruit production rates. 
5. Conclusions 
In summary, our study examined the five species of insects, namely, A. cerana cerana, V. bicolor, 
V. velutina, V. ducalis, and P. zonata, visiting C. osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera in Guangxi, 
South China. The peak visiting times of these insects occurred from 10:00 to 14:00. Fruit production 
rates significantly increased after cross-pollination by these insects.
